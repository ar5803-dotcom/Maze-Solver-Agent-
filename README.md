# Maze-Solver-Agent
Overview

The Maze Solver Agent is a sophisticated program adept at navigating mazes efficiently using Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms. This intelligent agent excels in determining the optimal path to reach the goal.

Features:

1. BFS and DFS Integration: Utilizes BFS for systematic exploration and DFS for deep exploration, combining both algorithms to find the shortest and most efficient path.

2. Optimal Path Determination: Ensures the discovery of the shortest route to the goal by leveraging BFS, while DFS explores potential alternative paths.

3. Visualization: Provides visual representations of the maze-solving process for enhanced understanding.
