# Maze-Solver-Agent- A maze, characterized by intricate pathways and branches, challenges solvers to navigate efficiently to reach their destination in the shortest possible time. Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role in devising optimal maze-solving strategies. The utilization of Graph Theory emerges as a powerful tool in crafting proficient approaches to maze-solving. In this context, a graph serves as a representation of sets of nodes and edges, with mathematical structures modeling pairwise relations between these nodes. Through proper interpretation and mathematical modeling, it becomes feasible to determine the shortest distance between any two nodes, a concept crucial for solving mazes with multiple cells. The maze dimensions, such as 8x8, 16x16, or 32x32, correspond to the number of cells. Each cell, isolated by walls or edges, equates to a node in graph theory. This alignment of graph theory with mazes establishes a foundational framework for the development of maze-solving algorithms.
Various maze-solving algorithms contribute to the automated resolution of mazes, including:
•	Fibonacci Heap
•	Dijkstra's Algorithm
•	Depth-First Algorithm
•	Breadth-First Algorithm
•	A* Algorithm
This comprehensive exploration of maze-solving methodologies showcases the synergy between AI, graph theory, and algorithms, providing valuable insights into the intricate world of maze navigation.
